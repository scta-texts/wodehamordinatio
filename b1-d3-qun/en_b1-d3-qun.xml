            And he adds that a greater good 
            is always more choice worthy.
            Therefore, 
            by an equal reasons, 
            the human mind combined with any good 
            is better than the mind alone.
            Therefore, 
            what is composed from this mind and body, 
            namely man, 
            is more noble than the mind alone.
          </p>
          <p xml:id="b1d3qun-ismnrd">
            Again, if the human mind is the image of the uncreated Trinity,
            therefore this is either 
            by reason of its substance
            (which is not the case 
            because the mind 
            does not represent a distinction of persons), 
            or 
            by reasons of the acts
            which it causes and receives 
            (and this is not the case
            because these acts are not consubstantial).
            And the same thing 
            as if it were real <!-- translation remains difficult here for "haec idem quasi in re" but transcription seems correct -->
            is argued under another form thus: 
            if this were the case, 
            then the perfect cognition of that image
            would be able to lead to, or at least assist in, 
            knowing that Trinity is in God.
            The consequent is false
            because its cognition does not lead more greatly to true cognition of the uncreated Trinity 
            than anything else. 
            Proof, 
            for either there is in the soul a real distinction of powers 
            or this does not seem to be the case. <!-- "videtur abducere" is still difficult to translate; but this seems to make the most sense -->
            For if this were the case, 
            then there are diverse things 
            and consequently 
            they are either parts of the mind or accidents in it, 
            and thus this cognition would force us to think 
            that the persons are either parts of God or accidents in him, 
            and thus they are not God. 
            But if not, then it would force us to think 
            that the persons are not really distinguished.

              One of the common conditions is that

                From this difference another follows:

                but leads commonly into conforming belief

                <mentioned>a cow has travelled here</mentioned>,

                no argument is sufficiently able to prove

                Nor does this seem to me necessary in order to save the image

                if several powers were really the same,

                there is more dislikeness than likeness,
                and therefore I say that 
                there are not three things in our mind 
                that our really distinct, 
                among which there is 
                a similar ratio of the origin,
                of two things from one thing, 
                and of one thing from two, 
                with consubstantiality, 
                that is, 
                with an essential identity of 
                three really distinct things. 
                It is therefore necessary 
                that the ratio of the image
                is understood either 
                with respect to origination and distinction 
                or with respect to consubstantiality. 
                And above all this is not unsuitable for that in which 
                the ratio of the image
                (of which the substance of the soul is) 
                consists only principally or virtually.

                between which there is consubstantiality.
                It is nevertheless true that

                and some expressed image of it, 
                though equivocal. 
                Therefore when

                it is clear

                just as intellective and volitional acts.
                (And this different from the way it is in a brute, 
                where such acts are extended forms.)

                Similarly, 
                that actual intellection 
                is not distinguished from habit 
                is seen from the fact that 
                this would be generated from acts, 
                and then there would immediately 
                be a habit and a most perfect act 
                able to be received in this potency, 
                since the first act would be causative of the habit. 
                The consequent is false. 
                The consequence is clear 
                because the first act causes some degree of habit, 
                and the intellect 
                with this grade will cause more of the act 
                than it had been able to before it 
                had nothing from the habit. 
                Therefore the act would be intensified, <!-- intenderetur -->
                and the more intense the act, 
                the more of the habit it will cause, 
                and thus circularly without end, 
                until the intellect 
                has something of the species both of this and of that, 
                to the degree that it is able to reach. 
                But this is false.
                Therefore also this from which it follows is false, 
                namely that the act is distinguished from the 
                habit. 
                Therefore intellection is not, 
                like an offspring, 
                proceeding from the memory, 
                like a parent.

                agrees that actual intellection 
                is really distinguished from the species or habitual knowledge
                from which, 
                according to him,
                it is begotten, 
                as if an offspring from a parent, 
                but in this case from the mind, 
                just as the word is also
                an offspring of the one speaking.

                Nevertheless against his and my opinion,
                it is able to be argued 
                through the arguments of those who hold 
                that actual cognition is able, 
                while remaining subjectively in the mind, 
                to cease to be intellection, 
                such that in this case

                not existing as an intellection, 
                but as a species or habit.
                Therefore this same thing 
                which is the species or habit 
                when the soul is not in the act of thinking
                becomes actual thinking when the soul begins to think. 
                Therefore a species or habit distinct from such actual thinking 
                is needlessly posited, 
                and as a consequence it would be needless 
                to posit a real part of the second part of the image 
                coming from the species or habit of the intellect,
                which naturally presupposes it in the same thing. <!-- translation remains difficult here; esp. "it" and "the same thing" -->
                The assumed is proved

                And the latter is not true 
                because in the sight of an animal, 
                while something is seen,
                the vision remains continually equally extended 
                because thus two-footed whiteness act in the whole eye and sight of the animal 
                in the same way as one footed whiteness.

                it follows that it has the vision more removed than before, 
                but such remission does not occur through the gradual subtraction of one part 
                because forms are not intended or remitted in this way.

                  vel speciem vel quovis alio nomine appelletur. Apud me tamen magis,

                  vocari a ponentibus eam aliquid in potentia praevium primo actui 
                  quod non credo esse necessarium nec verum, et cum probatur quod habitus vel species

                  praevia primo actui. Posteriorem tamen bene recipit qualitatem quae 
                  saepe vocatur species ab auctoritatibus, et secundum veritatem est habitus. 
                  Alio modo accipitur sensus pro composito ex tali potentia et organo 
                  corporeo cuius est actus et forma, et sic loquendo in sensu, 
                  id est, in organo quod est altera pars sic accepti, sensus recipitur

                <p xml:id="b1d3qun-hqcsif">Haec est responsio modo communior, scilicet, 
                  quod cum habetur actus primus sensationis intuitivae vel intensione intellectionis 
                  simul tempore semper virtute illius habetur duplex in homine: notitia abstractiva 
                  eiusdem una individualis et alia specifica, quarum duarum 
                  utraque stanti relinquit dispositionem vel habitum, qui, cum intellectu, sufficiat 
                  post in absentia obiecti, tunc intuitivae cogitati ad abstractivum actum 
                  in qualem non poterat ante intuitionem talis obiecti. Et tunc est 
                  respondendum quod in prima generatione habitus est potentia ita attenta circa primum 
                  obiectum suum mediante cogitatione eius intuitiva quod nihil advertit de 
                  abstractiva sua cognitione, sed solum per discursum postea sibi 
                  innotescit quod talis causabatur quia habitum in potentia derelinquit et dicere 
                  secundum hanc suam responsionem secundam quod portio primo causata de habitu 
                  nihil ultra de actu disponit sed causabatur. Ideo ut esset 
                  principium actus ulterius in futuro et quod postea quando, cum isto habitu, 
                  intellectus principat novum actum propria virtute et habitus. Verum 
                  est quod actus causatus relinquit additionem ad habitum priorem, 
                  sed illa portio habitus advertens priori ex novo actu qui 
                  actus processit ab intellectu et priori habitu nihil agit ad actum ex 
                  quo causatur ita vice et hoc quia intellectus est iam prius natura latus 
                  et adhibitus tantum illi obiecto respectu cuius est ille actus causatus  
                  virtute sui et habitus philosophici quantum potest pro ista vice prius 
                  natura ut dixi quam informe habita portione habitus nova 
                  nec ideo ingeniavit natura habitum causari vel talem habitus portionem 
                  ut tunc serviat ad actum aliquem cum positio est, sed ideo potius 
                  illa nova portio accrescit ut ipsa serviat in futurum.</p>

                  est, intellectus non adhibetur obiecto nisi applicetur causaliter

                  addita est suo toti in eodem instanti quo primo est particula

                  dandum quod totus actus C tenetur ab  habitu vel habitibus ex
